# Peer-to-Peer Network with Bucket-Based Welcome Packet Transfer

## Overview
This project implements a peer-to-peer (P2P) network where peers can communicate by transferring a welcome packet. The network uses buckets to facilitate packet transfer, allowing peers to join and leave the network dynamically.
